\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__rx__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-rx\-\_\-t} \\*Link layer reception unit. It contains the net2 socket to listen and accept on as well as the partner socket to read from. Finally, it also contains the read function }{\pageref{structnet2__link__rx__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-t} \\*Contains the two links to send and receive data as well as the two function to deal with both }{\pageref{structnet2__link__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__tx__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-tx\-\_\-t} \\*Link layer transmission unit. It contains the net2 socket to communicate through as well as we the write function }{\pageref{structnet2__link__tx__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__socket__t}{net2\-\_\-socket\-\_\-t} \\*Structure containing the socket and its address structure }{\pageref{structnet2__socket__t}}{}
\end{DoxyCompactList}
