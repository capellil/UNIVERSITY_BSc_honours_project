\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__linked__element__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-linked\-\_\-element\-\_\-t} \\*A linked element containing a net2 link, forming a linked list when chained. They are used in the link manager for dynamically growing structure }{\pageref{structnet2__link__linked__element__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__manager__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-manager\-\_\-t} \\*The link manager structure. It contains a collection of links and ensures that one a link is registered per node }{\pageref{structnet2__link__manager__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__rx__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-rx\-\_\-t} \\*Link layer reception unit. It has a function to read from the given socket }{\pageref{structnet2__link__rx__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__server__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-server\-\_\-t} \\*The link server is in charge of handling incoming connections requests from remote nodes which want to create a communication between one of their channel and on of its channel. It therefore checks from the link manager than those channels are not already connected with a net2 link }{\pageref{structnet2__link__server__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-t} \\*Contains the two links to send and receive data as well as the two function to deal with both }{\pageref{structnet2__link__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__link__tx__t}{net2\-\_\-link\-\_\-tx\-\_\-t} \\*Link layer transmission unit. It has a function to write to the given socket }{\pageref{structnet2__link__tx__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnet2__socket__t}{net2\-\_\-socket\-\_\-t} \\*Structure containing the socket and its address structure }{\pageref{structnet2__socket__t}}{}
